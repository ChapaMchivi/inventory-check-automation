# Inventory Check Automation (n8n + Gemini)

An automated weekly inventory auditing system built with n8n, Google Gemini, and Google Sheets. This workflow checks stock levels, identifies items below their threshold, generates an AI‑crafted alert message, and emails a consolidated low‑stock report. It removes manual review, reduces errors, and ensures timely restocking decisions.

- Google Sheets integration for real‑time inventory data
